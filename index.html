                    <p> <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> is a young

                        functional programming language on the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a>
                        platform, suitable for small and large programs.
                        Because it runs on the JVM, all Clojure programs can
                        use all the standard and third-party Java libraries
                        freely.  It offers tools for many tasks that are harder
                        with other languages:

                    <p> The course is one week long with a focus on workshop
                        sessions. The course material is in English. The
                        course is an introduction to functional programming
                        with a dynamically typed language.

                        We start with an introduction to Clojure; its syntax
                        and running it.
                    </p>

                    <p> You should have basic Java programming skills. No prior
                        experience with functional programming is required.</p>

                        Metropolia in 2012.
