                        <p>A course on functional programming with Clojure</p>
                    </header>

                    <p> <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> is a young
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lispish</a>
                        functional programming language on the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a>
                        platform, suitable for small and large programs.
                        Because it runs on the JVM, all Clojure programs can
                        use all the standard and third-party Java libraries
                        freely.  It offers tools for many tasks that are harder
                        with other languages:

                    <p> The course is one week long with a focus on workshop
                        sessions. The course material is in English. The
                        course is an introduction to functional programming
                        with a dynamically typed language.

                        We start with an introduction to Clojure; its syntax
                        and running it.
                    </p>

                    <p> You should have basic (Java) programming
                        skills. No prior experience with functional
                        programming is required.</p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">(defn hello [name]
  (println "Hello," name))</pre>

                    <p> The course is based on previous courses given
                      at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied
                      Sciences in 2012 and at University of Helsinki
                      CS department in 2011 and 2012.
